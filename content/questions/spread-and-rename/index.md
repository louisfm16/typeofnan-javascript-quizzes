Consider the following array of objects... okay, well one object. What happens when we spread that array and change the `firstName` property on the 0-index object?

```javascript
const arr1 = [{ firstName: 'James' }];
const arr2 = [...arr1];
arr2[0].firstName = 'Jonah';

console.log(arr1);
```

<!-- explanation -->

Spread does a shallow copy of the array, meaning the object contained in `arr2` is still pointing to the same object in memory that the `arr1` object is pointing to. That there is only one object in memory and changing its `firstName` property will be reflected when logging `arr1` or `arr2`.
