`a` and `b` are different objects with the same `firstname` property. Are these properties strictly equal to each other?

```javascript
const a = {
  firstname: 'Bill'
};

const b = {
  firstname: 'Bill'
};

console.log(a.firstname === b.firstname);
```

<!-- explanation -->

The answer is yes, they are. `a.firstname` is the string value `Bill` and `b.firstname` is the string value `Bill`. Two identical strings are always equal.
